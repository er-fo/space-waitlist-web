        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how [Your Company Name] ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our Space desktop application, associated software, and related services (collectively, the "Service").</p>

        <h3>1.1. Information You Provide to Us</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you register for an account, we collect information such as your email address, name, and password. This is managed through our third-party authentication provider.</li>

                    <li>The contents and geometric data of the CAD files you are working with. The Service needs to analyze these files to understand their structure.</li>
                    <li>Your responses to questions the Service may ask to better understand your design intent (e.g., during the reverse-engineering process for existing STEP files).</li>
                </ul>

            <li><strong>Communications:</strong> If you contact us for support or other inquiries, we will collect the information contained in your communications.</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for various purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain the Service:</strong> We use your User Content (prompts and file data) to perform the core function of the app, which is to generate and modify your CAD models.</li>
            <li><strong>To Improve the Service:</strong> We may use anonymized and aggregated User Content and Usage Data to train our AI models, improve our algorithms, and develop new features. We will take steps to ensure this data does not identify you personally.</li>

These providers have access to your information only to perform tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. These include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>AI Providers:</strong> We send your User Content (specifically your prompts and relevant geometric data from your files) to AI service providers like <strong>Anthropic</strong> to process your natural language requests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Authentication Providers:</strong> We use services like <strong>AWS Cognito</strong> to manage user accounts and authentication securely.</li>
                    <li><strong>Other Providers:</strong> We may use other providers for services like cloud hosting, analytics, and customer support.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if we believe it's required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our rights, property, or the safety of our users or the public.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</li>
