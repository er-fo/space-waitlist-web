Version: 2026-01-18  
Effective until replaced. 

**Definitions:** “CADAgent,” “we,” “our,” and “us” mean the controller named below. “Service” means the CADAgent Autodesk Fusion 360 add-in, supporting backend, and related websites/APIs. “You” and “users” mean account holders and anyone using the Service.

By accessing or using CADAgent you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the service.

## Controller & Contact Information
- **Controller:** Erik Fornlund (individual developer)
- **Email:** eriknollett@gmail.com
- **Purpose:** Operating CADAgent, an AI-powered natural language interface for Autodesk Fusion 360.

## 1. Service Description
CADAgent provides an AI-powered natural language interface for Autodesk Fusion 360 that allows users to generate CAD modeling operations using large language models (LLMs). The service operates on a Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) basis, requiring users to provide their own API keys for Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, or Google Generative AI services.

## 2. BYOK Model – Critical Terms
- **User responsibility:** You are solely responsible for obtaining, securing, and managing your own LLM provider API keys. CADAgent does not provide, sell, or manage API keys on your behalf.  
- **API costs:** All costs incurred from LLM API usage are your sole responsibility and are billed directly by your chosen LLM provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google). CADAgent may track token usage for your information but does not charge for LLM inference.  
- **No API key storage:** CADAgent does not store your API keys on our servers. Keys are stored locally on your machine in encrypted form and are transmitted only to your chosen LLM provider for inference.  
- **API key security:** You are responsible for keeping your API keys confidential. CADAgent is not liable for unauthorized use of your API keys or any associated costs.

## 3. Service Availability and Limitations
- **Rate limits:** CADAgent enforces rate limits per user (100 requests per minute). Excessive use may result in temporary suspension.  
- **Connection limits:** Maximum 200 concurrent connections; additional attempts may be rejected.  
- **Session limits:** Conversation history is limited to 200 messages per session; older messages roll off.  
- **Third-party dependency:** CADAgent relies on Supabase for authentication and on the selected LLM providers for inference. We are not responsible for outages, performance issues, or changes in those services.  
- **No uptime guarantee:** CADAgent is provided “as-is” without uptime or availability guarantees. Features may change or be discontinued without notice.

## 4. User Responsibilities
- **Fusion 360 license:** You must maintain a valid Autodesk Fusion 360 license; CADAgent does not provide Fusion 360 licensing.  
- **Provider compliance:** You must comply with the terms of service of your chosen LLM provider when using their APIs through CADAgent.  
- **Data backup:** You are responsible for backing up CAD designs and related data. CADAgent is not a backup solution.  
- **Legal use:** You agree to use CADAgent only for lawful purposes and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.  
- **Accuracy verification:** AI-generated CAD operations may contain errors. You are responsible for reviewing and verifying all generated code and geometry before use.

## 5. Intellectual Property
- **User designs:** You retain all intellectual property rights to CAD designs created using CADAgent. We claim no ownership of your design files or geometry.  
- **Service IP:** CADAgent (code, algorithms, prompts, documentation) is proprietary to the provider and protected by intellectual property laws.  
- **LLM output:** Ownership or licensing of LLM-generated content may be subject to your LLM provider’s terms; review those terms separately.

## 6. Liability Limitations
- **LLM costs:** We are not liable for any costs arising from LLM API usage, including excessive token consumption due to bugs, errors, or malicious use.  
- **Design errors:** We are not liable for errors, inaccuracies, or defects in AI-generated CAD operations. You must validate results.  
- **Third-party services:** We are not liable for issues arising from Supabase, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, or Autodesk Fusion 360.  
- **Data loss:** We are not liable for loss of session logs, conversation history, or CAD context data; maintain your own backups.  
- **Overall cap:** To the maximum extent permitted by Swedish law, our total aggregate liability arising out of or related to the service is limited to the greater of 
- (a) amounts you paid us for the service in the 12 months before the claim, or 
- (b) 10,000 SEK. 
We exclude all indirect, consequential, special, punitive, and loss-of-profit damages. Nothing in these Terms limits liability for intent (uppsåt), gross negligence (grov vårdslöshet), or other liability that cannot be limited under mandatory Swedish law.

## 7. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the provider and its affiliates from claims, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of: (a) your use of LLM provider APIs and associated costs; (b) your CAD designs and their downstream use; (c) your violation of these Terms or applicable law; or (d) unauthorized use of your API keys or credentials.

## 8. Account Termination
We may suspend or terminate access if you: (a) violate these Terms; (b) abuse rate limits or platform resources; (c) use the service for illegal or malicious purposes; or (d) fail to comply with LLM provider terms. You may terminate at any time by discontinuing use and following the stated account closure process (email support if provided). Suspension or termination does not relieve you of accrued obligations.

## 9. Beta / Testing Disclaimer
CADAgent may include beta or testing features provided “as-is” without warranties and subject to change. We disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Use beta features at your own risk.

## 10. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
These Terms are governed by Swedish law without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Disputes shall be finally settled by the courts of Sweden, with Stockholm District Court (Stockholms tingsrätt) as first instance. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) does not apply. If you are considered a consumer under Swedish law, mandatory consumer rights apply to the extent they cannot be waived.

## 11. Modification of Terms
We may modify these Terms at any time. Changes will be posted at the designated URL and, where practicable, notified by email or in-app. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

## 12. Miscellaneous
- **No waivers or assignments:** Failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver. You may not assign these Terms without our written consent; we may assign without restriction.  
- **Severability:** If any provision is unenforceable, it will be replaced with an enforceable term that most closely reflects the intent, and the remainder stays in effect.  
- **Entire agreement:** These Terms form the entire agreement for the service and supersede prior understandings on this subject. No agency, partnership, or employment relationship is created by use of the service.
