        <p>Last updated: [Date]</p>

        <p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE: These Terms of Service contain important provisions, including a disclaimer of warranties, a limitation of liability, and a clause regarding governing law and disputes. Please read them carefully.</strong></p>

        <p>Welcome to Space! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Space desktop application, associated software, and any related services (collectively, the "Service"), provided by [Your Company Name] ("we," "us," or "our").</p>
        <p>By accessing or using our Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Service.</p>

        <h2>1. The Service</h2>
        <p>Space is a desktop application that acts as a universal CAD AI assistant. It allows you to modify and interact with your computer-aided design (CAD) files using natural language prompts. The Service works by processing your prompts, analyzing your existing design files, and generating code or instructions to modify those files within your local environment.</p>

        <h2>2. User Accounts</h2>
        <p>To use certain features of the Service, you may be required to create an account. You are responsible for safeguarding your account information and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.</p>

        <h2>3. User Content and Intellectual Property</h2>
        <h3>3.1. Ownership of Your Content</h3>
        <p>You retain full ownership of your intellectual property rights in the CAD files, designs, prompts, and any other content you provide to the Service ("User Content"). We do not claim any ownership rights over your User Content.</p>

        <h3>3.2. License Granted to Us</h3>
        <p>To operate and provide the Service, you must grant us a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive license to access, use, process, copy, modify, create derivative works of, and display your User Content. This license is granted solely for the purposes of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Providing, maintaining, and improving the Service.</li>
            <li>Analyzing your CAD files and prompts to generate modifications.</li>
            <li>Responding to your requests and providing support.</li>
            <li>Training and improving our AI models and algorithms. Any User Content used for training will be anonymized and aggregated to the fullest extent possible to protect your privacy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This license ends when your User Content is deleted from the Service.</p>

        <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree not to use the Service for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms. You agree not to:</p>

            <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to discover the source code or underlying algorithms of the Service.</li>
            <li>Use any automated system, including "robots" or "spiders," to access the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to our servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period.</li>
            <li>Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service or its data.</li>
            <li>Use the Service to develop a competing product or service.</li>

Your use of these third-party services is subject to their respective terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for the practices of any third-party services.</p>
